        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about the different basic CSS commands. I particularly enjoyed using Google fonts as it 
            allowed me to have more creative freedom with my websites. Furthermore, I enjoyed adding different colours to my fonts to
            enable viewers to discern different texts from each other. Furthermore, I enjoyed categorising the different sections of my
            website which allowed me to organise my texts better to assign them specific colours and fonts. </p>
