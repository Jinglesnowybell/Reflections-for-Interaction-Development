        <h1> Week 2 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about the different basic CSS commands. I particularly enjoyed using Google fonts as it 
            allowed me to have more creative freedom with my websites. Furthermore, I enjoyed adding different colours to my fonts to
            enable viewers to discern different texts from each other. Furthermore, I enjoyed categorising the different sections of my
            website which allowed me to organise my texts better to assign them specific colours and fonts. </p>
            
        <h1> Week 3 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more HTML Forms. I enjoyed learning more about how tedious it was to make these
            forms and had a deeper appreciation for people who do make forms.
        </p>

        <h1> Week 4 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about responsive images. I particularly enjoyed how to make the images responsive as it
            allowed me to understand the complexities of CSS. </p>

        <h1> Week 5 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about Javascript. I particularly enjoyed how interactive the class was and would
            like to learn more from the person in the video again. </p>

        <h1> Week 6 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about the basics of Javascript. I particularly enjoyed learning about javascript objects as it
            allowed me to make my coding more organised. </p>

        <h1> Week 7 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about DOM. I particularly enjoyed learning about the DOM tree as it showed just how
            complex Javascript was. </p>

        <h1> Week 8 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about jquery and API. I particularly enjoyed how complicated both the materials were
            and would like to do it more. </p>

        <h1> Week 9 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about bootstrap. I particularly enjoyed how different bootstraps could be used to attain
            a similar result through manual coding in an easier way. </p>

        <h1> Week 12 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about restDB. I particularly enjoyed how restDB sent data to a database which then allowed the form
            to check in with the data before either allowing or not allowing a user to enter something in. </p>

        <h1> Week 14 Reflection </h1>
        <p> From the slides, I learnt more about lottie animation. I particularly enjoyed how to implement lottie in different context of web development
            and would do it again in the future. </p>
